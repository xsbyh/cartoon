        Sora (ソラ) is the main protagonist of the Kingdom Hearts series, and
        the sole playable character in the original game.[1] He is portrayed as
        a cheerful 14-year-old boy who lives on the Destiny Islands with his
        childhood friends

        and

        Kairi. When the Islands are attacked by creatures of darkness known as
        the Heartless, Sora comes into possession of a weapon of light called
        the Keyblade,[13] and he embarks on a journey alongside Donald Duck and
        Goofy to protect other worlds from the Heartless, Nobodies, and other
        forces of evil. Nomura has stated that Sora's name can be interpreted as
        "sky",[14] as the Japanese word for sky is sora (空).[15] <br /><br />
        Sora was initially designed by the Kingdom Hearts series director and
        character designer Tetsuya Nomura during a discussion between Disney and
        Square about who the series's protagonist should be. Wanting an original
        character, Nomura made various sketches of Sora until the design met the
        approval of Disney. Throughout the series, Sora has been voiced by Haley
        Joel Osment in the English version and Miyu Irino in the Japanese
        version. For his depiction as a child in the prequel Kingdom Hearts
        Birth by Sleep, Sora was voiced by Luke Manriquez and Takuto Yoshinaga
        in English and Japanese, respectively. Sora has made supporting
        appearances in other games from the series and reprised his role in
        manga and light novel adaptations of the games.
