        Kairi. When the Islands are attacked by creatures of darkness known as
        the Heartless, Sora comes into possession of a weapon of light called
        the Keyblade,[13] and he embarks on a journey alongside Donald Duck and
        Goofy to protect other worlds from the Heartless, Nobodies, and other
        forces of evil. Nomura has stated that Sora's name can be interpreted as
        "sky",[14] as the Japanese word for sky is sora (空).[15]
